Data
-----

Big Data --> store across multiple machines

Types of Data
--------------
unstructured data    :  raw text
structured data      :  names, strings ..
semi-structured data :  xml

* Snapchat is built entirely on Google AppEngine, it has no infrastructure


Definitions
------------
Data Model: collection of concepts for describing data
Schema: description of particular collection of data, using a given data model
Relational Model of Data: relation, basically a table with rows and columns.
                          every relation has a schema, which describes the
                          columns, or fields

Relational Database
--------------------
Provides a basis for high level data language which yields maximal
independence between programs on the one hand and machine representation on
the other (Codd, Turing Award 1981)

Logical data independence: protection from changes in logical structure
Physical data independence: protection from changes in physical structure


Example: University Database

Conceptual Schema
------------------
Students(sid: string, name: string, login: string, age: integer, gpa: real)
Courses(cid: string, cname: string, credits: integer)
Enrolled(sid: string, cid: string, grade: string)

Pyhsical Schema
----------------
Relations stored in unordered files
Index on first columns of Students, first 2 cols enrolled


Database Management System (DBMS)
----------------------------------
Database: integrated and organized collection of data
DBMS: software that stores, manages and/or facilitates access to databases


DBMS Provides the following
----------------------------
* "Declarative" queries & data independence
   say what you want, not how to get it

* Help avoid data corruption

* Protection from other users/jobs/queries
  as if you are the only person accessing the DB

* Fault tolerance and durability
  database is protected even if failures occur in the middle of processing

* Tools and interfaces for building applications



Creating Relations in SQL (DDL)
--------------------------------
CREATE TABLE Students
  (sid CHAR(20),
   name CHAR(20),
   login CHAR(20),
   age INTEGER,
   gpa FLOAT)


CREATE TABLE Enrolled
  (sid CHAR(20),
   cid CHAR(20),
   grade CHAR(20))


Adding and Deleting Tuples
---------------------------
INSERT INTO Students (sid, name, login, age, gpa)
  VALUES ('53688', 'Smith', 'smith@ee', 18, 3.2)

Disks, Buffers, Storage
------------------------

To find records for all 18 year old students with GPA's over 2.0
  
  SELECT *
    FROM Students S
   WHERE S.age=18
     AND S.gpa > 2.0;


Generic SQL queries
--------------------
SELECT [DISTINCT] target-list
  FROM relation-list
 WHERE qualification;


Can specify a join over two tables
-----------------------------------
  SELECT S.name, E.cid
    FROM Students S, Enrolled E
   WHERE S.sid=E.sid AND E.grade='B';


Basic Query Semantics
----------------------
1. do FROM clause: Compute cross-product of tables
2. do WHERE clause: Check conditions, discard tuples that fail
3. do SELECT clause: Delete unwanted fields
4. if DISTINCT is specified, eliminate duplicate rows


Aggregate Operators
--------------------

COUNT (*)
COUNT ([DISTINCT] A)
SUM ([DISTINCT] A)
AVG (A)
MAX (A)
MIN (A)

  SELECT COUNT (*)
    FROM Students;

  SELECT AVG (S.gpa)
    FROM Students S
   WHERE S.age=18;

  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT S.age)
    FROM Students S
   WHERE S.name='Bob';


GROUP BY and HAVING
--------------------
SELECT S.major, AVG (S.gpa) as AvgGPA
  FROM Students S
 GROUP BY S.major
HAVING COUNT (*) > 10;


Why not store data in main memory?
-----------------------------------
1. Costs too much
2. Main memory is volatile

  Note some specialized systems do store entire databse systems in main memory

Disks and Files
----------------
READ   transfer page of data from disk to RAM
WRITE  transfer page of data from RAM to disk

Disk Space Management
----------------------
Lowest layer of DBMS software manages space on disk (using OS file system?)
High levels call upon this layer to

  allocate/de-allocate page
  read/write a page

Best if a request for a sequence of pages is laid put sequentially on disk


Terminlology
-------------
Disk Page      the unit of transfer between disk and memory
               typically set as config parameter for DBMS
               typically between 4KB and 32KB

Frame          unit of memory
               typically same size as the disk page size

Buffer Pool    collection of frames used by DBMS to temporarily keep data for
               use by query processor


Buffer Control Block (BCB)
  frame#
  pageid
  pin_count
  dirty
