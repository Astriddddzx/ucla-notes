## Computer Graphics

* Art
* Mathematics
* Vision
* Optics
* Biomechanics
* Physics
* Engineering
* Artificial Intelligence

* Learning how to store & display (manipulate) visual data

### Applications

* Entertainment
  - Films
  - Computer Games
  - Visual Reality

* Scientific Visualization
  - Medical Visualization
  - Flight Simulation
  - Architecture

* Education

### History

* 2000 B.C.
  - Orthographic Projection

* 1400s
  - Perspective: Italian Renaissance

* 1600s
  - Coordinate Systems: Descartes
  - Optics: Huygens
  - Calculus, Physics, Optics: Newton

* 1897 Oscilloscope: Braun

* 1950 - 1970
  - Computers with Vector Displays

* 1966
  - First true raster display

* 1993
  - 1200x1200, 500k triangles.sec, 36-bit color, stereo, texture mapping... all at 60Hz

* 1995
  - Feature-length CG films

* Today ... still rapid evolving

* OpenGL

### Genesis of Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques

* Ivan E. Sutherland, 1963
  - "Sketchpad"

### Quiz

1. When was the term 'Computer Graphics' first stated?
  - William Fetter of Boeing coins the term 'Computer Graphics' for his human factors

4. Which is the first **animated** moveie to employ CG?
  - "The Great Mouse Detective" (1986) was the first animated film to be aided by CG.

7. Which is the newest CG animated movie?

8. Which is bigger in terms of gross revenue, the game industry or the (Hollywood) movie industry?
  - The game industry

### Split between Games & Film

* Active - Games
* Passive - Film

### What is an Image / Video?

* Array of pixels (one or more numbers)

* A video of time sequences of images

* How they are formed:
  
  - Objects in the world (static or dynamic)
  - Illumination (light sources)
  - Imaging device (eye, camera)

* We want to synthesize images / videos

### Basics Elements

* Modeling
* Animations
* Rendering
* Interaction

#### Rendering

Visibility
Simulating light propagation

* Reflection
* Aborption
* Scattering
* Emission
* Interference

#### Animation

Keyframe animation
Motion capture
Procedural animation

* Physics based animation
* Behavioral animation

#### Interaction

Input/Output

#### Modeling

Representing objects geometrically on a computer
Alternate representation
Altering geometric models

### Elements of CG

The graphics pipeline:

`Modeling ---> Animation ---> Rendering`

### Syllabus

* Learn the mathematical basics of graphics
* Apply them in 3 programming assignments
* Show that you know them in 2 exams
