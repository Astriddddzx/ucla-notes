### Leetcode 62. Unique Paths

**Question:** A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid. The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid. How many possible unique paths are there?

**Answer**:
```python
class Solution(object):

    def uniquePaths(self, m, n):
        """
        :type m: int
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """

        paths = [[None for x in range(n)] for y in range(m)]

        for i in range(m):
            paths[i][0] = 1
        for j in range(n):
            paths[0][j] = 1
        
        for i in range(1, m):
            for j in range(1, n):
                paths[i][j] = paths[i-1][j] + paths[i][j-1]
        
        return paths[m-1][n-1]
