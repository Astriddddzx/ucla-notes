Defining the Learning Task
---------------------------
Improve on task T with respect to performance metric P, based on experience E

T: Playing checkers
P: Percentage of games won agianst arbitrary opponents
E: Playing practice games agianst itself

T: Recognizing hand-written words
P: Percentage of words correctly classified
E: Database of human-labeled images of handwritten words

T: Driving on four-lane highways using vision sensors
P: Average distance travelled
E: Learning from human drivers


Supervised Learning: Regression
--------------------------------
Given (x1, y1), (x2, y2), ... , (xn, yn)
Learn a function f(x) to predict y given x

* y is real-valued == regression


Unsupervised Learning
----------------------
Given x1, x2, ... , xn (without labels)
Output hidden structure behind the x's

- e.g. clustering
- independent component analysis - separate a combined signal into its
  original sources


Framing a Learning Problem
---------------------------

Representing Instances/Examples
--------------------------------
What is an instance?
How is it represented?

- Define a list of features.
  This is how the algorithm views the data.
  Features are the questions we can ask about the instances.
  
  Red Apple: red, round, leaf, 3oz, ...
  Green Apple: green, round, no leaf, 4oz, ...
  Yellow Banana: yellow, curved, no leaf, 4oz, ...
  Green Banana: green, curved, no leaf, 5oz, ...

During learning/traning/induction, learn a model of what distinguishes apples and bananas based on the features.
Generate a classifier.

With a new instance, apply the classifier.
Classifier classifies a new instance based on the features.

Learning Algorithm
-------------------
Learning is about generalizing from training data
What does this assume about training and test set?

We care about the performance of the learning algorithm

We start with a loss function L(y, y^)
Tells us how bad the system's prediction of y is compared to the true value
of y

- A loss function for regression (squared loss)
  L(y, y^) = (y - y^)^2

- A loss function for classification
  L(y, y^) = 0   if y = y^
             1   otherwise
