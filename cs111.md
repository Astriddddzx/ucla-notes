## Why study operating systems?

* Build on concepst from other courses
  - data structures, programming languages, assembly language, computer architectures

* Why study OS?
  - Setup, configure, manage computer systems
  - Write programs that exploit OS features
  - Work with complex, distributed, parallel software
  - Work with abstracted services and resources

* Many hard problems are found in OS context
* Many hard problems solved in OS context
  - synchronization, security, integrity, protocols, distributed computing, dynamic resource management

* High standards
  - performance, correctness, robustness
  - scalability, extensibility, reusability

* Policy (how to do something) vs. Mechanism (mechanical way to do something)
  - Policy determines what can/should be done
  - Mechanism implements basic operations to do it
  - Mechanisms shouldn't dictate or limit policies
  - Policies must be changeable without changing mechanism

* Parallelism and aysnchronoy are powerful and necessary
* Performance and correctness are often at odds

Interfaces
===========
* An interface specification is a contract
  - Specifies responsibilities of producers & consumers
  - Basis for product/release interoperability
  - Cannot break the contract

* Interface vs. Implementation
  - An implementation is not a specification
  - Many complaint implementations are possible
  - Inappropriate dependencies cause problems

* Modularity and functional encapsulation
  - Complexity hiding and appropriate abstraction
  - Divide complex project into simples sub-projects

## Basics of operating systems

* Abstracted resources
  - simplifying, generalizing
  - serially reusable, partitioned, sharable
    + Linux (reuse files): uses files to represent everything
    + World Wide Web (reuse URLs): uses URL to create links

What is an OS?
---------------
- It is low level software (bottom right above hardware)
  - Provides more usable interface for hardware
- Provides better, more usable abstractions of the hardware below it
- Allow easy, safe, fair use of sharing resources

* Manages hardware for programs
  - Allocates hardware and manages its use
  - Enforces controlled sharing (and privacy)
    + OS allows access and denies access to files
  - Oversees execution and handles problems
    + Deals with hardware problems
    + Deals with software problems
    + Makes sure other software is not affected by one software

* Abstracts the hardware
  - Makes it easier to use and improves software portability
  - Optimizes performance

* Provides new abstractions for applications
  - Powerful features beyond the bare hardware
    + Floating point software makes it look like we have floating point hardware

* Set of management & abstarction services
  - Invisible, happens behind scenes

* Applications see objects and their services
  
  - CPU supports data-types and operations
    + bytes, shorts, longs, floats, pointers ...
    + add, subtract, copy, compare,  indirection ...
  
  - So does OS, but at higher level
    + files, processes, threads, devices, ports ... 
    + create, destroy, read, write, signal ...

* An OS extends a computer
  - Create a much richer virtual computing platform
    + support richer objects, more powerful operations

What's special about the OS
----------------------------
* It controls the hardware
  - Automatically loaded when machine boots
  - First software that accesses hardware
  - Continues running while apps come & go (ALWAYS RUNS)

* It alone has **complete access** to hardware
  - Privileged instruction set, all of memory & I/O

* It mediates applications' access to hardware
  - Block, permit, or modify applciation requests

* It is trusted
  - To store and manage critical data
  - To always act in good faith

* If the OS crashes, it takes everything else with it

What functionality is in the OS?
---------------------------------
* As much as necessary, as little as possible
  - OS code is **very expensive** to develop and maintain
  - Movement of super-small OS

* Functionality must be in the OS if it
  - Requires use of privileged instructions
  - Requries the manipulation of OS data structures
  - Must maintain security, trust, or resource management

* Functions should be in libraries if they
  - Are a service commonly needed by applications
  - Do not actually have to be implemented inside OS

* But there is also the performance excuse
  - Some things may be faster if done in the OS

Where to offer a service?
--------------------------
* Hardware, OS, library, or application?
* Increasing requirements for stability as you move through these options
* Hardware services rarely change
* OS services can change, but it's a big deal
* Libraries are a bit more dynamic
* Applications can change services much more readily

* Things everybody uses belongs in lower hierarchy
* Things used by fewer people belong higher

OS & speed
-----------
* There's a push to move services with strong performance requriements down to the OS
