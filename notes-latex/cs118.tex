{\bf Processing Delay}: Time to examine packet's header, determine where to direct the packet, check for bit-level errors in the packet, etc.

{\bf Queuing Delay}: Packet waits to be transmitted onto link. Depends on number of earlier packets. Queuing delay is 0 if queue empty. be zero. Queuing delay long if traffic heavy.

{\bf Transmission Delay}: Length of the packet = $L$ bits, transmission rate of the link from router A to router B = $R$ bits/sec, Transmission delay is $\frac{L}{R}$.

{\bf Propagation Delay}: Time for bit to propagate from start of link to other router. Depends on medium of link.

{\bf Traffic Intensity}: Average rate packets arrive at queue = $\alpha$ packets/sec. Transmission rate (bits pushed out of queue) is $R$ bits/sec. All packets consist of $L$ bits. Average rate bits arrive at queue is $L\alpha$ bits/sec. Assume queue can hold infinite bits, $\frac{L\alpha}{R}$ is traffic intensity.

{\bf End-to-End Delay}: $d_{end-end} = N(d_{proc}+d_{trans}+d_{prop})$, $d_{trans}=\frac{L}{R}$ where $L$ is packet size.

{\bf Internet Protocol Stack}: {\bf Application Layer}: Support data exchange. FTP, SMTP, HTTP. {\bf Transport Layer}: Handle delivery reliability, multiplex within host. TCP, UDP. {\bf Network Layer}: Forward packets from source to destination. IP, routing protocols. {\bf Link Layer}: Transfer data between directly connected network elements. Ethernet protocol. {\bf Physical Layer}: Bits ``on the wire".

{\bf IPv4 a.b.c.d/x}: {\bf \#bits}: x, {\bf \#endpoint addr}: $2^{32-\text{x}}$, {\bf net addr}: a.b.c.d, {\bf net mask}: leading x 1s the rest 0s, {\bf broadcast addr}: (addr $|$ ($\sim$mask))

{\bf Routing Table}: Match prefix to outgoing link. Exists on every host and router. {\bf Longest Prefix Matching}: Longest net addr prefix with net mask. Routing table next-hop.
