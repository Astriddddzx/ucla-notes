{\bf 1. Introduction: What is Myth?}

{\bf muthos}: alternative spelling: mythos. The word `muthos' is used in Homer to refer to a formal, authorative speech, often before an audience. Gradually, however, the meaning of muthos changes over time. In the Classical period, Plato contrasted muthos with logos. In this, he paved the way for the modern interpretation of myth as an untrue story.

{\bf trado}: The Latin verb `trado, tradere' means ``to hand down". It is where our word tradition comes from.


{\bf 2. Hesiod: The Creation of the Greek Cosmos}

{\bf Archaic Period}: The Archaic Period of Greece runs from approximately the 8th to the 6th centuries, BCE, and predates the Classical Period. In the archaic period, Greek epic and lyric poetry flourished. Homer, Hesiod, and the author of the Homeric Hymns all composed in the archaic period. See further: Powell, A Short Introduction to Classical Myth, pp. 55-57.

{\bf Chaos}: The first principle, from which the cosmos emerges. See Theogony lines 115 following.

{\bf Epic}: The earliest surviving form of Greek literature, epic is a form of poetry that flourished in the archaic period. It began as an oral form (Homer recited the Iliad and the Odyssey from memory) but was later written down. See further Homer, Hesiod, Theogony.

{\bf Gaia}: Gaia is the Greek goddess of the Earth. She is born after Chaos (Theogony 115 ff.). She partners with Ouranos and gives birth to the race of Titans. Overpowered by the weight of Ouranos, Gaia gives her unborn son, Kronos, a sickle with which to castrate his father.

{\bf Muses}: Daughters of Memory, the Muses appear at the beginning of the Theogony, and at the beginning of the Iliad and the Odyssey. They are invoked by the epic poet to help him begin and remember his song.

{\bf Olympians}: The children of the Titans. The most important Olympian is Zeus (king of the gods). Aphrodite is also an Olympian, although she is technically born in an earlier generation. The Olympians get their name from Mt. Olympos, where they live as a somewhat happy, somewhat unhappy family. The Greeks liked to think of the Olympians as being 12 in number, but in practice the number was greater. They are Zeus, Hera, Demeter, Poseidon, Hestia, Hades, Hephaestus, Athena, Apollo, Artemis, Ares, Hermes, Persephone, Aphrodite, Dionysos (we first meet them in Hesiod's Theogony, but we will talk alot more about this group of gods as we move through the course).

{\bf Ouranos}: Son and mate of Gaia, Ouranos is the god of the sky. He is castrated by Kronos in the early part of the Theogony.

{\bf Primordial Gods}: These are the very first gods to populate the universe in Hesiod's Theogony. They include Chaos, Gaia, and Ouranos.

{\bf Theogony}: Epic poem about the origins of the cosmos (a `cosmogony' (birth of the cosmos) as well as a `theogony' (birth of the gods)); composed by Hesiod; Hesiod appears as a character in his own poem in the prologue.

{\bf Titans}: The children of Ouranos and Gaia as described in Hesiod's Theogony. Although they live forever, Hesiod refers to them as ``the gods from before" (that is, before the reign of Zeus - see Olympians).


{\bf 3. Battle, Succession, and Interpretation}


{\bf Athena}: (alt. sp = Athene). Goddess of wisdom. Emerges from Zeus' head in the Theogony. Special protector of Odysseus and Telemachus in the Odyssey (appears to Telemachus in the guise of Mentes and Mentor in bks 1-4).

{\bf Kronos}: The son of Ouranos, Kronos tries to fight off succession by swallowing his own children. He is a god of the older generation (a Titan), married to Rhea, and father of Zeus and many of the other Olympians. His story is told in the Theogony. In the Roman tradition, Kronos is renamed `Saturn'. See further Goya, ``Saturn Devouring His own Children (under images)."

{\bf Metis}: Greek word meaning ``cunning". The first wife of Zeus in the Theogony, whom Zeus swallows when she is pregnant with Athena.

{\bf Rhea}: Wife of Kronos in the Theogony. Mother of Zeus, whom she hides away to save from Kronos.

{\bf Typhoios}: Monstrous child of Gaia and Tartaros. Typhoeus challenges Zeus' rule in the Theogony and is eventually defeated by him. Compare lecture 7, where an alternative version of the birth of `Typhaon' (same god) is given in the Homeric hymn to Apollo.

{\bf Zeus}: Supremely powerful ruler of gods and men. Zeus is the son of Kronos and the leader of the Olympians. The Theogony tells the story of his succession and celebrates his rule. He appears in many other myths that we will address in this course. In the Iliad, Zeus is the arbitrator of events (he holds the scales which determine Hector must die) and he also presides over Odysseus' fate on his journey home in the Odyssey (see the council of the gods, Od. 1)


{\bf 4. Near Eastern Parallels}

{\bf Enuma elish}: see Powell chapter. Babylonian Succession myth featuring the god Marduk and his rise to power.

{\bf Kingship in Heaven}: Hittite succession myth that details story of Kumarbi, and the birth of storm-god Teshub from Kumarbi's body.

{\bf Kumarbi}: Servant of Anush who replaces him in succession for royal/divine power. Bites off Anush's genitals, swallows his semen, and becomes pregnant with the storm god Teshub, whom he gives birth to through the ``good place" (thought to be his penis).

{\bf Marduk}: The supreme god in Babylonian mythology, featured in the Nr. eastern text called the Enuma elish.

{\bf Song of Ullikummi}: Hittite myth which continues Kingship in Heaven. Tells of birth of stone child Ullikummi and his fight with the storm god Teshub.

{\bf Succession Myth}: A kind of myth which deals with the succession of sons over fathers over a number of generations. Many Greek and Near Eastern myths use this format to tell of how a divinity came to be a supreme ruler.


{\bf 5. The Myth of Prometheus and the Origin of Women}

{\bf Age of Heroes}: See `Ages of Man' (ID). Hesiod Works and Days. 
The group of mythological heroes who died in the Trojan and Theban wars.

{\bf Ages of Man}: Hesiod, Works and Days pp. 26-29. the five ages (also called `races') of mankind are Gold, Silver, Bronze, Heroic, Iron. You should know all of these individually for an ID, but when discussing one or another on an ID you should also be able to put them into context in relation to one another. Through the ages of man Hesiod tells a story of the gradual decline and generation of the human race and their lot upon the earth.

{\bf Bronze Age of Man}: See `Ages of Man' (ID). Hesiod Works and Days pp. 26-29. Hard, warlike group. Violent. Killed one another off in war. This group has nothing to do with the so-called ``Bronze Age" period of Greek history.

{\bf Elpis}: The Greek word for `hope' and `expectation.' Elpis is the only thing left inside Pandora's jar when she opens it in the Works and Days (lines 115 ff.)

{\bf Epimetheus}: Hesiod, Theogony, Works and Days. The slow-witted brother of Prometheus who accepts Pandora as a bride.

{\bf Golden Age of Man}: These men lived in the `golden age' - the time when men lived without toil or disease, under the rule of Kronos. 
Hesiod Works and Days (see also `Ages of Man' ID).

{\bf Iron Age of Man}: See `Ages of Man' (ID). The worst age for mankind. This is the age of toil, disease, good mixed with evil. Pandora seems to have in some ways set this age in motion by opening up her jar.

{\bf Pandora}: Hesiod, Theogony, Works and Days. Pandora is the first woman, and creates the race of women. She is manufactured by Zeus and the other gods in return for (and as punishment for) Prometheus' theft of fire. Pandora is married to Epimetheus and opens up the jar that she was given (and told not to open) with disastrous results for the history of human kind.

{\bf Prometheus}: Hesiod Theogony and Works and Days. Prometheus is a Titan who tricks Zeus twice, first through the fixing of the sacrifice, second by stealing fire back for men. In later traditions, such as Aeschylus' play Prometheus Bound, Prometheus is represented explicitly as a culture - hero (a little bit of extra info not mentioned in lecture). Although a god, Prometheus is often associated with man and humankind. He is punished by Zeus for his transgressions.

{\bf Silver Age of Man}: See also `Ages of man' (ID); Hesiod Works and Days.  Men lived as children for 100 years, and then died after a brief adolescence. Did not honor gods.

{\bf Delphi}: Homeric hymn to Apollo. Site of Apollo's sanctuary and oracle in Northern Greece (see map in Athanassakis).

{\bf Hera}: Hera is the wife of Zeus and queen of the gods. Her special province is marriage. Ironically, her own marriage to Zeus is full of problems.

{\bf Hermes}: The trickster god who is born from Zeus and Maia. He begins life in relative obscurity but works his way into the Pantheon, where he takes on the honors or attributes (timai) of messenger, shepherd, and companion to mortals. He is also the god of boundaries and travel.

{\bf Homeric Hymns}: see Athanassakis (intro). A collection of hymns in honor of the gods, composed in the archaic period.
